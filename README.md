# PyMongo Sample Apps

These applications are used in the MongoDB University learning platform. They are intended to be used within virtual labs that provide learners structured practice using the PyMongo driver.

These applications are cloned in the startup script for Instruqt labs. For reference, review the startup script for the labs, located in [10gen/curriculum](https://github.com/10gen/curriculum/) repo.
